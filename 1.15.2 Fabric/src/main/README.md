If you wish to compile the source code yourself, you'll need to download [SimpleConfig by magistermaks](https://github.com/magistermaks/fabric-simplelibs/tree/master/simple-config) and put it in the `src/main/java/net/forgingbeyond/cce/`directory.
The source code also requires Mixins if it wasn't obvious.

This version of the source code is different than the main 1.16.5 version and thus is in its own folder.
