# This mod is no longer maintained.
I have no motivation to continue this little project as I'm slowly moving away from Java as my primary language.
I don't remember my credentials to CurseForge either, and thus the mod will remain in the state it is now.
In theory the mod should continue working in 1.19, but I have neither tested this nor do I have will to do so.


# Forging-Beyond
## Forging Beyond mod for Minecraft has one simple purpose:
Modify anvil block's behavior to allow forging items in survival that cost more than 40 levels to forge.

The mod generates a config file using [SimpleConfig by **magistermaks**](https://github.com/magistermaks/fabric-simplelibs/tree/master/simple-config).
The file will be located in your minecraft directory under the config folder, where you may modify the XP level limit to your liking.
For more information, see the said config file.

**For the mod to work properly, you also need to download [Fabric API for the respective minecraft version!](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)**
