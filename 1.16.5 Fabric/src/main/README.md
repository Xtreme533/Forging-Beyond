If you wish to compile the source code yourself, you'll need to download [SimpleConfig by magistermaks](https://github.com/magistermaks/fabric-simplelibs/tree/master/simple-config) and put it in the `src/main/java/net/forgingbeyond/cce/`directory.
The source code also requires Mixins if it wasn't obvious.
